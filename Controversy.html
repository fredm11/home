   		<h1 class="center">Controversy</h1>
   		<h2 class="center">The Japanese Suicide Forest</h2>
   		<p>The most controversial action that Logan Paul has committed in his entire career.
   		It started when he went to Japan as a vacation and to make his daily documentaries 
   		more interesting. During his time in Japan, he was disrespecting the Japanese culture 
   		and making a racist joke towards the culture. As you can see in his videos, and throwing 
   		Poke-balls at humans since Pok√©mon originates from Japan and being very obnoxious in 
   		the most sacred places in Japan. The outrage peaked when he filmed himself finding a 
   		dead body in the notorious Aokigahara Forest which was given the name the Japanese suicide
   		forest. He knowingly went into a restricted area that clearly marked so that tourist don't 
   		encounter these horrific events. But due to his nature, he finds a person who has sadly 
   		taken his own life and started to film his dead body and laugh when He also didn't bother 
   		to burr the body but only the face. In addition, he didn't take down the video and over 6 
   		million saw the video before he decided to take down the video.</p>
   	 	<h3 class="center">The Outrage</h3>
   	 	<p> After his horrific actions, he obviously had to suffer consequences, some of these
   	 	may include the removal of him in Google-preferred, which give large creators premium 
   	 	ads which in return generates more money for the creator. Next, after this incident,
   	 	many of his fans decided to create some memes of him during his horrific actions which 
   	 	were hilarious for the majority of people. Finally, many large news networks such as 
   	 	<a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/">Fox News</a> were reporting on this issue.</p>
   	 	<h3 class="center">The response</h3>
   	 	<p>After deleting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot28hhOaX2Q">video</a> that controversial 
   	 	video he decided to come back to YouTube. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWjxSkJpxFU">first video</a> 
   	 	that he posted after the controversy was with the famous Kevin Hines who jumped off the golden gate and survived. 
   	 	In addition, he talked to the Dr. John Draper, the Director of the national suicide prevention lifeline to see his 
   	 	actual consequences of his actions and disrespecting the dead. As a result, he donated one million dollars to the 
   	 	suicided prevention line. With this YouTube started to put ads on his video again.</p> 
   	 	<h2 class="center">Animal Abuse</h2>
   	 	<p>After the suicide controversy and coming back to YouTube and donating one million dollars 
   	 	to the national suicide prevention line, not even a week passed before he was involved in 
   	 	another controversy. The first few videos he was seen abusing animals. For example, he was
   	 	seen electrocuting a dead rat that he found in the garbage can. In addition, he was jokingly
   	 	giving a fish CPR when he thought it wasn't breathing. After, these remarks the outrage 
   	 	followed was catastrophic.</p>
   	 	<h3 class="center">The outrage</h3>
   	 	<p>These actions resulted in a vast amount of backlash. First and foremost, YouTube 
   	 	suspended all of his advertisements which is his revenue. This was shocking because 
   	 	it was the first time that YouTube has done that to that magnitude of a Channel. 
   	 	Next, the large Organization, PETA reached out and was criticizing Logan Paul for 
   	 	his actions and received outrage from his fans and other YouTube creators.</p>

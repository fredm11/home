   		<h1>Controversy</h1>
   		<h2>The Japanense suicide forest</h2>
   		<p>The Most controversial action that Logan Paul has committed in his entire career.
   	 	It started when he went to Japan as a vacation and to make his daily documentaries 
   	 	more interesting. During his time in Japan he was disrespecting the Japanese culture
   	 	and making racist joke towards the culture. As you can see in his videos, and  
   	 	throwing pokeballs at humans since pokemon orgiates from japan and being very 
   	 	obnoxious in the most sacret places in japan. The outrage peaked when he filmed 
   	 	himself finding a dead body in the notorious Aokigahara Forest which was given the name the Japanese suicide forest.
   	 	He knowingly went into a restricted area that was clearly mark so that
   	 	tourist don't encounter these horrific events. But due to his nature he finds a 
   	 	person who has sadly taken his own life and started to film his dead body and 
   	 	laugh when, He also didn't bother burr the body but only the face. In addition, 
   	 	he didn't take down the video and over 6 million saw the video before he decided 
   	 	to take down the video. If you're struggling with depression or have thought
   	 	about killing yourself please get help.</p>
   	 	<h3>The outrage/backlash</h3>
   	 	<p>After his horrific actions he obviously had to suffer consequences, some of these
   	 	may include the remove of him in google-preferred, which give large creators premium 
   	 	ads which in return generates more money for the creator</p>
   	 	<h3>The response</h3>
   	 	<p>After deleting the video that controversial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWjxSkJpxFU">video</a>
   	 	 he decided to come back to Youtube. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWjxSkJpxFU">first video</a> that he posted after the 
   	 	 controversy was with the famous ____ who notoriously jumped off the golden gate 
   	 	 and survived. In addition, he talked to the manger of the suicide hot-line to see
   	 	 his actual consequences of his actions and disrespecting the dead. As a result, he donated one million dollars 
   	 	 to the suicided prevention line. With this youtube started to put ads on his video 
   	 	 again.</p>
